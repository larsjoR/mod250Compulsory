##Setup
Setup instructions is located in the "Instructions" directory, in the "Setup.pdf" file.

##Deployment
The "Packages" directory contains the deployment-ready application, both archived (.ear) and "exploded" (deploy the folder). If configurations are needed in the .XML-files, the easiest way is to edit the files in the "exploded" package before deploying it.
